  |*  To do so, add a custom link to your menu with a URL of "/"; that should   *|
  |*  point visitors to your site's home page. (If your site is in a subdirec-  *|
  |*  tory, use "/path/to/site/" as the URL.)                                   *|

  be shown (not set up, menu location not assigned, etc.) [voyagerfan5761]
